Slate
============

Slate is a project to create a worthwhile newtab page in Chrome, which displays immediately relevant content on a dashboard. To this end, it must present summaries of content from several APIs that don't necessarily have RSS feeds (though there'll be that too), in a way that is reusable and completely open source.
