Dashboarder
===========

Dashboarder is a project to create a worthwhile newtab page in Chrome, which displays immediately relevant content. To this end, it must present summaries of content from several APIs that don't necessarily have RSS feeds (though there'll be that too), in a way that is reusable and completely open source.
