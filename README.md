Slate
============

[![Build Status](https://semaphoreci.com/api/v1/edmundnoble/slate/branches/disable-apps/badge.svg)](https://semaphoreci.com/edmundnoble/slate)

Slate is a project to create a worthwhile newtab page in Chrome, which displays immediately relevant content on a dashboard. To this end, it must present summaries of content from several APIs that don't necessarily have RSS feeds (though there'll be that too), in a way that is reusable and completely open source.
